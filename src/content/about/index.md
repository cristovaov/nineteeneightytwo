Within a short period of time, the 1982's became quickly known for their energetic rock and the stage antics of their singer. Despite their best efforts a single for their poster song "Girls Prefer Winners" on a local record label never came about. After a line up change and going from two guitars to guitar/bass, the dynamics turned a bit more traditional and the band started incorporating effects to their music. While doing relatively well on stage, discussions with labels appeared to be difficult and friction between band members started to grow. In 2010 the band split, leaving behind a trail of vague memories, stale beers and confettis.</p>
<p>The band started off with Fred on vocals, Mathias on drums and soon joined by Ferhad on guitar. 
From end 2007 the line up was: 
Frederic Gaillet - vocals, Mathias Wille - drums, Ferhad Ronse - guitar, Cristovao Verstraeten - guitar.  And from halfway 2009:
Frederic Gaillet - vocals, Mathias Wille - drums, Cristovao Verstraeten - guitar, Arnaud Vanrafelghem - bass.</p>
